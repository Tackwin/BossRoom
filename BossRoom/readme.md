# BossRoom
It's my one of my (if not the) **_first_** project made available to the public.
I don't have any style guide or sanity check, i'm trying to make a game and to finisf it.

## The game
The game will be a rogue like, you need to defeat bosses, each boss having it's own room and different pattern, the bosses loot weapons...
pretty standard stuff for now, i will add more thing as i progress.


### Dependencies

#### SFML
https://www.sfml-dev.org/documentation/2.4.2/
I use it entirely for the input, audio, graphics and system, i might use it to do some networking.
Although i might want tu use another framework/make my own, but thgis is way too far ahead of us.

#### Json
https://github.com/nlohmann/json
I use this little header only project to parse json. 

that's about it for my dependencies, everything else is handmande :)
